                                    Every day, we learn something new, every day is a life lesson. We learn one way, others learn another, and we teach others, absorbing the material and making it our own information, which we often show others, in a never-ending cycle of acquiring knowledge.
                                    Everything relies on strategy, research, and communications.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    I devote a significant amount of time to planning.
                                    Make a to-do list, a rough sketch of what I want to see, and bring my vision to life. Of course, nothing goes according to plan; there are a hundred ways to make it much easier or a hundred ways to make it more difficult; either way, I get up to a new day and arise, with a new mindset, and manage to make things work, and that is how I cope with strategic planning.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Given that we live in the digital world, we are not obliged to know everything, which I appreciate. We frequently forget what day it is or what happened in October 2017, but we always have a method to go back, our social media accounts, images, and videos to recall what happened on that day, and we always leave something behind. So, when I'm coding or creating and can't remember what to do, I go back to my prior notes and projects, or I ask Google, my colleagues, or a person hundreds of miles away who knows the solution to my question. The best thing I could do is research and ask questions; I am never alone.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                   Communication is fantastic; social media, messenger, snapchat, slack, email, any form is necessary; I wouldn't be where I am without it; I wouldn't be here without friends, family, coworkers, and fellow colleagues; they are always a message away and always happy to assist me or vice versa to one another to ensure we complete our tasks. My colleges and friends are the reason for my advancement in programming, no one did this on their own, we always learn from each other.

                            The reason for woke, the reason of my strength, the reason why I get by every single day.
                            I'm a mother to Emily, and a wife to Jose, my wonderful husband.
                            We are a team to make everything possible for our daughter to have her dreams to become a reality.

                            My realm includes photography, art, books, music, coffee, and games.
                            My passion, my getaway from everything else occurring in my life and in the world.
                            I can take screenshots of reality utilizing my phone or camera.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Painting or creating anything with music playing in the background, getting deeply invested in a project for hours and feeling perfectly relaxed whenever it's done.

                        <li>
                            Music, lyrics, or just the instruments of any form of music can bring you back to the present moment, relive a memory, and make you feel that it's normal to be emotional. There will always be music to make me feel how I do. Without saying anything, words are spoken.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Sitting by a window, sipping coffee and daydreaming about being a fairy, princess, killing a dragon, or whatever adventure my mind takes me on when I read my books.
                            I've lived a thousand lifetimes and a thousand more as a different characters in my videogames to have a sense of what it's like to be alive and exploring or finding during the journey. The best thing is that once you've finished the story, you can always go back and try again to relive the experience, or play another game to live a different life and be lost for days.
